# MSA 8700: Building Generative AI Business Solutions

This hands-on course focusses on developing generative AI applications. It covers large language models, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning frameworks. Students will explore retrieval-augmented generation, document processing, and vector databases. The course also delves into the architecture and deployment of agentic AI applications, image generation, and safeguarding AI systems. Through class activities, students will apply these concepts to real-world scenarios, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of generative AI’s business applications.

This course offers an immersive, hands-on experience for students eager to delve into the world of generative AI technologies. This advanced course is intended for individuals who have already mastered the theoretical foundations of deep learning and large language models, as it builds directly on these concepts to explore their practical applications in business settings. Throughout the course, students will engage with a variety of topics essential to the development and deployment of generative AI applications. The journey begins with an exploration of large language models, providing a solid understanding of their capabilities and limitations. Students will then delve into the art of prompt engineering, learning how to craft effective prompts that optimize model performance. This skill is crucial for tailoring AI outputs to specific business needs. As the course progresses, students will investigate frameworks for prompt evaluation and optimization, ensuring that their AI models are both efficient and effective. Training and fine-tuning large language models is another critical focus, as students learn to adapt pre-existing models to new tasks and datasets. This involves mastering fine-tuning frameworks that enhance model accuracy and relevance. Benchmarking techniques are introduced to equip students with the tools needed to evaluate model performance rigorously. This knowledge is vital for ensuring that AI applications meet the high standards required in business environments. The course also covers retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), a cutting-edge approach that combines retrieval mechanisms with generative models to produce more informed and contextually aware outputs. Document processing for RAG is explored, providing students with the skills to handle and integrate large volumes of data effectively. Vector databases are introduced as a means of storing and retrieving complex data structures, enhancing the scalability and efficiency of AI applications. In the latter part of the course, students will examine the architecture of agentic generative AI applications, focusing on distributed and scalable deployment strategies. This knowledge is crucial for implementing AI solutions that can operate efficiently across various platforms and environments. The course also addresses the ethical considerations of AI deployment, including bias detection, privacy concerns, and federated learning. These topics ensure that students are not only technically proficient but also mindful of the broader implications of their work. The culmination of the course is a comprehensive project presentation, where students will demonstrate their ability to integrate and apply the concepts learned throughout the program. This project serves as a testament to their readiness to tackle real-world challenges in the field of generative AI.
