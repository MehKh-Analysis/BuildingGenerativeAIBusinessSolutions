Yes, the datasets mentioned—**Medical Meadow**, **Anki Flashcards**, and **MediQA**—are publicly available, but with certain conditions:

1. **Medical Meadow**: This dataset is publicly available as part of an open-source initiative. It includes a combination of established medical NLP datasets reformatted for instruction tuning, such as Anki Medical Curriculum flashcards and the MediQA dataset. The Medical Meadow dataset is explicitly stated to be accessible to researchers and practitioners for fine-tuning biomedical tasks<a href="https" targe="_blank">[4]</a><a href="https" targe="_blank">[7]</a>.

2. **Anki Flashcards**: Medical flashcards created by students for the Anki platform are openly shared on repositories like AnkiWeb and GitHub. These decks cover a wide range of medical topics, including anatomy, physiology, pathology, and pharmacology. While they are publicly accessible, some repositories may require acknowledgment or adherence to specific conditions for use<a href="https" targe="_blank">[5]</a><a href="https" targe="_blank">[8]</a>.

3. **MediQA**: The MediQA datasets (e.g., MediQA-AnS, MediQA-Corr) are also publicly available but often require registration or signing a data usage agreement (DUA). For instance, datasets like MediQA-AnS can be accessed via platforms such as GitHub or AIcrowd after completing necessary formalities<a href="https" targe="_blank">[6]</a><a href="https" targe="_blank">[9]</a><a href="https" targe="_blank">[20]</a>.

Thus, while these datasets are accessible for research purposes, users may need to meet specific requirements (e.g., registration or agreeing to terms) depending on the dataset's hosting platform.
